# Welcome to My Bootcamp Blog
## I am a little late getting this started, but I'm glad I finally got it going. I'll be updating this more as I go through the bootcamp, and I can't wait to get better at it!
1. My first week in the bootcamp was definitely not what I expected. I struggled with learning git and all of the processes involved with GitHub, and it started to freak me out a little bit. I've always been a quick learner, but this is something that I've never dealt with before, and it really caught me off guard. I started to think it wasn't for me, but after taking a step back and realizing that I wasn't raised to be a quitter, I got back to it and I'm more motivated to learn. It was just a lot of information to take in, and being in a remote setting makes it much more difficult.
2. Git and Github were really difficult to understand for me. I wasn't sure of the correct order of switching from VSCode, to CLI, and GitHub, so it really threw me off and I got to the point where I was afraid of making mistakes.
3. I'm really excited to get started in HTML and CSS, because being able to design a web page to look how I want it to is something I've always wanted to do. I've also never been the most tech-savvy person, so I'm eager to learn all that I can to become a great software developer.
